# portfolio
Website per week 2 instructions.

Create a new directory in your 'foundations' directory called 'portfolio' or 'week2'. Initialize it as a Git repository.

In the 'portfolio' directory, create a bare bones, two page portfolio site. The pages should link to each other in the main navigation. One of the pages should be for selected projects, and list several projects, each with a title and small image. Be sure to include week1's assignment! I know you might not have a lot of projects to link to right now- just use dummy data and links that go nowhere to flesh it out as necessary. The second page can be whatever you like, though "About Me" is a nice default. Whichever you would like to be the landing page for the site should be named index.html.

Use dummy content wherever you like on these pages. We'll be revisiting this project over the next several weeks, and you can update it then. If you don't care to make a portfolio site for yourself, you can keep it all dummy content or a different subject, as long as one page involves a list of links. The focus should be on writing clean, semantic HTML. We will add CSS to this site starting next week. Please do not do any styling this week.

There are no length requirements on these pages, but I expect each to have header, article, and footer sections, with relevant, semantic content within each. File names should be "kebab style" (lower case, hyphens insted of spaces) and internal links should be correct. As always, formatting style matters. If you are including local images, they should be inside a directory called "images" within the main project directory.

Remember to view your pages in different browsers before turning this in. If you've made HTML errors that reduce the functionality of the page, you'll lose points, and they're easy to catch by just viewing it in a browser!

Use git to commit as you go along. Create a Github repository called 'portfolio' and link it to your local repository. Push your work up to Github, and submit a link to the Github repo for the assignment. Refer to class 1's slides if you need a refresher on Git & Github.
